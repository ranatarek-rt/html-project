<h2 style="color:blue"><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p style="font-size:19px">Artificial intelligence is the study of intelligent behavior, its ultimate goal is the theory of intelligence that accounts to the behavior of naturally occurring intelligent entities and that guides the creation of artificial entities capable of intelligent behavior. Artificial intelligent is a both branch of science and a branch of engineering.</p>
<h3>In engineering:</h3><p style="font-size:19px">Artificial intelligence in engineering is concerned with the concepts, theory and practice of building intelligent machine,in engineering sector Artificial intelligence is used to comibne software and hardware systems.Think of robots in a manufacturing facility and the software that controls them.Without any doubt, smart production lines are the future of manufacturing. Now, (AI) engineers are able to build machines capable of replicating just about anything that humans can do.Maybe one of the most notable examples of Artificial intelligence in engineering is in the manufacturing of automobiles. Initially, robots were able to perform basic tasks of engineering requiring great movement but Today, these machines are able to do precision work , particularly handling the most complicated or complex tasks.</p>
