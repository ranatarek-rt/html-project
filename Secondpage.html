<h2 style="color:blue"><u> Artificial Intelligence: </u></h2>
<p style="font-size:19px">Artificial intelligence is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled (robot) to perform tasks that are commonly associated with intelligent beings, or it is the study of intelligent behavior.Intelligence behavior includes understanding, thinking, learning , communication and acting in complex environment.Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been shown that computers can be programmed to perform very complex tasks such as discovering evidence for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great skill.However, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are still no programs that can match human versatility over broader domains or in tasks that involve a great deal of daily knowledge. On other hand some programs have achieved the level of performance of human experts and professionals in the performance of certain specific tasks.In general, psychologists do not define human intelligence by a single trait but by the combination of many different abilities. Artificial intelligence research focused mainly on the following intelligence components: thinking, reasoning , problem-solving, comprehension, and language-use. </p>
<h3 style="color:blue"><u> Importance of artificial intelligence:</u></h3>
<p style="font-size:19px">Artificial intelligence is changing our environment rapidly. Major improvements in AI capabilities have led to a range of developments in our homes, including autonomous vehicles and connected Internet of Things devices in our homes. Artificial intelligence also  contributes to the development of a brain-controlled robotic arm, which can help a paralyzed person feel again via complex direct human-brain interfaces. Artificial intelligence has the potential to impact almost all aspects of our society, including our economy, but it's not without technological obstacles and threats to build and use the new technologies that artificial intelligence brings.</p>
