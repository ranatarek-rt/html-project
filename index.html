<h2 style="color:blue"><u>Intelligence</u></h2>
<p style="font-size:19px">I believe that understanding intelligence implies understanding how knowledge is acquired, represented and sorted, how intelligent behavior is generated and learned how motives and emotions and priorities are developed, and how sensory signals are transformed into symbols,how  symbols manipulate to perform logic to reason about the past and plan for the future, how the mechanism of intelligence produce the phenomena of illusion, belief, hope and dreams.i think artifitial intelligence is a very impotrtant topic to talk about.</p>
