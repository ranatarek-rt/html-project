<h2><b><u>Applications on artificial intelligence:</u></b></h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Artificial Intelligence ( AI) percolates through modern society. Just as technology made a leap from analog to digital, and communications catapulted forward from rotary dial phones to smartphones, FaceTime, and WhatsApp, AI has gone away from the need for hundreds of square feet of computers to play chess to identify faces with silicon thumbnail. Artificial intelligence became  part of our everyday life and that's why there are a lot of applications on AI and we are going to give some examples about those applications. </p>
<h2 style="color:blue"><u> Examples: </u></h2>
<p style="font-size:20px"> Fields in which AI methods are executed: artificial life, automated reasoning, robotics, Bio-inspired computing, Hybrid intelligent system, Semantic Web and Behavior-based robotics. </p>
<p style="font-size:20px"> AI in businesses: Artificial intelligence is already widely used in business applications, including automation , data analysis and natural language processing. Those three AI fields streamline operations across industries, and improve efficiencies. and there are also other common business uses for AI include Transferring and cross-referencing data,Consumer behavior forecasting and product recommendations, Fraud detection, Personalized advertising and marketing messaging and Customer service via telephone or chatbots. </p>
<p style="font-size:20px"> AI in medicine: Artificial intelligence is now poised to make a major contribution to medical and biological applications. From medical equipment to diagnosing and predicting disease to image and video processing, artificial intelligence has proved to be a potentially wide field. Researchers in healthcare system mainly focus on the region of major three diseases: cardiovascular disease, nervous system disease, and life-threatening cancer. The ability of AI to make  educated decisions, understand and interpret the environment and anticipate those actions, among its many other abilities, allows AI's ability to make educated decisions, understand and interpret the environment and anticipate those actions, among its many other abilities, allows this application of paramount importance in today's world. </p>
